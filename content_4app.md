About:
Donate a mole is a citizen science project to improve the early detection of melanoma. 

Melanoma rates continue to increase, with the Australian incidence 12 times the global average, and it is the most common cancer in Australians aged 18 to 39 years.

Melanomas can occur anywhere on the body, help us find the ‘hotspots’.

About
Donate a mole is a citizen science project to improve the early detection of melanoma. Melanoma rates continue to increase, with the Australian incidence 12 times the global average, and it is the most common cancer in Australians aged 18 to 39 years.

The University of Queensland Dermatology Research Centre is a world leading team of researchers studying skin cancer. We aim to empower Australians to become citizen scientists by using the tool that everyone has in their back pocket, their mobile phone. By “donating a mole”, we hope to increase awareness of skin cancer risk, while contributing to our world-renowned research program. The images will form an image database of moles, suspicious lesions and melanomas that will assist researchers in identifying melanoma HOTSPOTS.

Donate a mole is an open source application developed at HealthHack.

## Being a Citizen Scientist
Gather data: take a photo of your moles on your body, tag the location to help find the hotspots.

A citizen scientist is a person who helps researchers gather or interpret data, especially for large data sets that would have been impossible to collect or sift through in the past. We need your help to collect as many moles and their locations to create the HOTSPOT map.
