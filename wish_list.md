Notes from Melissa:

What are the groups thoughts on the following:
- should we have a guest and registered user (which may give us follow up opportunity if you think we need that)
-should we have a page with the ABCDE of moles?
- Flow: photo first, then tag ion body map
- Do we need to be able to tell mole sizes? how to do that?
- Can we reject (or do we need to) photos of poor quality?
